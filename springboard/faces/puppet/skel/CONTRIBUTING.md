# Contributing

## Contributing to control repo

If you wish to contribute to the control repo, we require you create a feature branch with any relevant Puppetfile or hiera changes.  Once your feature branch has been committed you may create a merge request into our testing branch.  Once the feature branch has passed CI validation checks it can be merged into the testing branch and promoted to production at the next release.

## Contributing to core repo

Contributions to the core repo come in the form of standardized OS baselines and profiles for other users in the company to consume.  If you have a valid need for a standardized profile, please create a feature branch with the relevant code. Once your code has been pushed you can follow the contribution guidelines for the control repo to create a feature/test branch to validate the new code.

## Contributing to other modules

Most other Puppet code will either be a utility / unitasker module, like Anthill or nginx, or a Product module, like Asset Services or Unisporkal.  In these cases, teams may have differing contribution guidelines, which should be stated within this CONTRIBUTING.md document.  If you have any further questions or need guidance in how to proceed with a development effort, please visit #help-puppet in Slack or come see the Springboard Team.
